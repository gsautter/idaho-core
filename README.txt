This project is not an application proper; it rather provides the (shared) base
libraries for multiple other projects. The Ant build script produces four JAR files
in the "dist" folder, namely:

- StringUtils.jar: Utilities and widgets for using and managing lists of strings, CSV
                   files, and regular expression patterns

- HtmlXmlUtil.jar: Utilities and widgets for working with HTML and XML data and XSLT,
                   including an XPath engine with an extensible function library

- EasyIO.jar: Utilities for working with configuration files and JDBC, including a
              unified way of specifying relational schemas from within an application,
              plus utility classes for building web applications

- Gamta.jar: The GAMTA data model for representing XML documents, doing text analysis
             and markup, including a multitude of basic utilities and widgets for
             building text analysis tools


All four JAR files generated by Ant include both the Java sources and the class files,
as well as other resources requited for the code to work.


This project depends on the following external JAR files to build (all included in the
"lib" folder for convenience):
- servlet-api.jar
- mail.jar
- recaptcha4j.jar (included in version 0.0.7)
